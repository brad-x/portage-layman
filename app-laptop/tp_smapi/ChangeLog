  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  Fix compilation (bug #492964)

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Remove explicit notion of maintainer-needed, for GLEP 67

  GLEP 67 removes the explicit notion of maintainer-needed@g.o being used
  for packages lacking maintainers, in favor of assuming maintainer-needed
  whenever the package has no maintainers.

  28 Feb 2016; Ulrich Müller <ulm@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  metadata.xml: Add maintainer-needed comment to packages without maintainer.

*tp_smapi-0.42 (06 Aug 2016)

  06 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  -tp_smapi-0.41-r2.ebuild, +tp_smapi-0.42.ebuild:
  new version 0.42.

  This adds a new version 0.42, and updates the ebuild a bit.

  First, the ebuild was updated to EAPI=6. Then the RESTRICT=userpriv
  was removed, as it no longer seems to have any effect: I can install
  the package fine with FEATURES=userpriv. Next, an obsolete kernel
  version check was removed. Every version of every flavor of Linux
  sources we have in the tree is already newer than 2.6.19. Finally,
  einstalldocs (from EAPI=6) was used to install the current set of docs
  as well as a TODO that had been omitted.

  I have added myself as the maintainer of this package, since I still
  have hardware that it supports.
