  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  New ebuild boinc-7.6.31.ebuild

  Gentoo-Bug: 577490

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

  26 Apr 2016; Patrice Clement <monsieurp@gentoo.org> files/boinc.init:
  Migrated boinc.init to use start-stop-daemon

  The boinc init script can no longer start, attach or stop the boinc
  manager if openrc-0.20 and newer is used, because openrc no longer
  passes $SHELL to init scripts.

  To solve the issue the init script has been migrated to use
  start-stop-daemon instead of using 'su' directly.

  This change should have no impact for users of previous openrc
  versions.

*boinc-7.2.42 (04 May 2016)

  04 May 2016; David Seifert <soap@gentoo.org> +boinc-7.2.42.ebuild:
  New ebuild for boinc-7.2.42 with vsyscall check

  Gentoo-Bug: 577490, 578750

  The ebuild is essentially the same as for the new boinc-7.6.31 with
  the following exception:

  The 7.2 series can not be built with wxGTK:3.0, therefore this ebuild
  uses wxGTK:2.8.

  Further a check against VSYSCALL kernel options has been added.
  Russell Knighton found out, that some projects segfault if VSYSCALL
  mappings are completely disabled, and reported the issue in bug
  578750.

  The check against CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_NONE and
  CONFIG_X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION is based on his patch submitted in the
  bug reported by him.

  Upgraded init script

  Gentoo-Bug: 574260

  After hot-fixing bug 574260, the following fixes/additions, suggested
  by Jan Chren were made:

  - #!/sbin/runscript -> #!/sbin/openrc-run
  - Variables from /etc/conf.d/boinc are checked, and empty variables
    are pre-filled with sane defaults.
  - split start() to start_pre() and start()
  - removed check_baselayout()
  - replaced /etc/init.d/boinc with ${RC_SERVICE}
  - replaced echo with einfo ""
  - replaced ${SVCNAME} with ${RC_SVCNAME}

  +boinc-7.2.42-r2.ebuild:
  Fix VSYSCALL check for boinc-7.2.42

  Gentoo-Bug: 578750

  The configuration options were misunderstood.

  - CONFIG_X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION only enables a dmesg message if any
    legacy application tries to use any vsyscall. If disabled, these
    applications simply segfault with no output in dmesg.
  - To make the old calls available, either
    CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_NATIVE or CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_EMULATE
    must be used.

  Therefore the ebuild was reverted to check against the
  CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_NONE option, and warns the user if this is
  set.
