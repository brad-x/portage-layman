  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  11 Nov 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> gauche-gl-0.5.1.ebuild,
  gauche-gl-0.6.ebuild:
  avoid using ${var^} and ${var,} as they do not work in bash-3.2

  Once these upgrade to EAPI=6, they can use these case modification
  features, so leave a reminder note in there.

  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)
