  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*mpm_itk-2.4.7_p3 (10 Sep 2015)

  10 Sep 2015; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> -mpm_itk-2.4.7_p2.ebuild,
  +mpm_itk-2.4.7_p3.ebuild:
  version bump from v2.4.7-02 to v2.4.7-03.

  The new version fixes an SSL/keepalive issue in some browsers. There
  is a mailing list thread here:

    http://lists.err.no/pipermail/mpm-itk/2015-August/000889.html

  The code change is minimal, but the impact is large. The old version
  has therefore been removed: "Everybody using the 2.4.x series is
  highly advised to upgrade."

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1

  +mpm_itk-2.4.7_p4-r1.ebuild:
  revert EAPI=6 ebuild to EAPI=5.

  The depend.apache eclass is not fully EAPI=6 compatible. Revert to
  EAPI=5 until it is. Thanks go to Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis
  for catching the mistake.
