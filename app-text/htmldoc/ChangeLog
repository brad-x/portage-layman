  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Remove explicit notion of maintainer-needed, for GLEP 67

  GLEP 67 removes the explicit notion of maintainer-needed@g.o being used
  for packages lacking maintainers, in favor of assuming maintainer-needed
  whenever the package has no maintainers.

  28 Feb 2016; Ulrich Müller <ulm@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  metadata.xml: Add maintainer-needed comment to packages without maintainer.

*htmldoc-1.8.29 (15 Apr 2016)

  15 Apr 2016; Andreas K. Hüttel <dilfridge@gentoo.org>
  +files/htmldoc-break.patch, +files/htmldoc-destdir.patch,
  +htmldoc-1.8.29.ebuild:
  Bump to version 1.8.29

  This bump includes 2 patches:
  - One to patch out the complete lack of DESTDIR support upstream
  - The other is to patch an annoying defect where failures in child
   Make targets result in "make" returning true, and the build finishing
   and installing in a broken state.

  Upstream have dropped SSL Support.

  This will hopefully resolve several bugs:
  - https://bugs.gentoo.org/572262 - Toralf
  - https://bugs.gentoo.org/549960 - Toralf
  - https://bugs.gentoo.org/527624 - Diego

  Thanks to Toralf Förster and Diego Elio Pettenò for reporting the bugs.

  02 Jun 2016; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gentoo.org> htmldoc-1.8.29.ebuild:
  respect system toolchain settings

  If CC and CXX variables are not exported to configure, it ignores
  system toolchain setup and forces its own compiler preferences,
  where clang/clang++ are on the first place if found. This is likely
  not what users want and causes configure failure if CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS
  contain flag(s) not supported by clang, but supported by gcc.
