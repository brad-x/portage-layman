*rtirq-20150216 (31 May 2016)

  31 May 2016; Patrice Clement <monsieurp@gentoo.org> +files/rtirq,
  +metadata.xml, +rtirq-20150216.ebuild:
  Initial commit.

  A crucial part of professional realtime audio is low latency. rtirq sets
  realtime priorities and scheduling policies for desired IRQ threads on boot.
  Without rtirq you would need to set these priorities yourself after each
  boot
  or live with sound dropouts. See also [1].
