  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*anacron-2.3-r3 (10 Aug 2015)

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> +anacron-2.3-r3.ebuild:
  anacron: revbump for various changes

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> anacron-2.3-r3.ebuild:
  anacron: clean up depend settings #370203

  We do not need to depend on sed (it is in @system), cronbase should be a
  runtime dep for cron daemons, and we do not need virtual/cron as anacron
  runs by itself just fine #370203.

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> anacron-2.3-r3.ebuild:
  anacron: use elog instead of einfo for messages #370199

  We want users to be able to read these after the fact, so make sure
  we log them accordingly.

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> anacron-2.3-r3.ebuild:
  anacron: EAPI: update to 5

  This allows us to show the elog messages only once on initial install.

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> files/anacron.rc6:
  anacron: init.d: do not require clock/hostname #546138

  If the system initializes these settings via other means (such as the
  kernel handling it), there's no need to force them to start up.  Change
  the "need" to "use" so that things work correctly.

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> anacron-2.3-r3.ebuild:
  anacron: install with normal permissions #291565

  There's no need to restrict the binary to the root user/group --
  it's not like normal users can't run programs themselves, and
  access to various state/config files are protected independently.

  This also fixes bad +x perms on the /etc config files.

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> anacron-2.3-r3.ebuild:
  anacron: improve CFLAGS/CC handling

  Rather than expand CFLAGS in the sed statement, pass it via the env later
  on when running make.

  Make sure we set up CC to a sane default.

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> anacron-2.3-r3.ebuild,
  +files/anacron-2.3-headers.patch:
  anacron: fix various missing prototype warnings

  10 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> anacron-2.3-r3.ebuild:
  anacron: update cron doc url #534516

  24 Aug 2015; Justin Lecher <jlec@gentoo.org> anacron-2.3-r2.ebuild,
  metadata.xml:
  Use https by default

  Convert all URLs for sites supporting encrypted connections from http to
  https

  24 Aug 2015; Mike Gilbert <floppym@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Revert DOCTYPE SYSTEM https changes in metadata.xml

  repoman does not yet accept the https version.
  This partially reverts eaaface92ee81f30a6ac66fe7acbcc42c00dc450.

  Bug: https://bugs.gentoo.org/552720

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

  18 May 2016; Austin English <wizardedit@gentoo.org> files/anacron.rc6:
  use #!/sbin/openrc-run instead of #!/sbin/runscript
