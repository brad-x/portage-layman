  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  metadata.xml: update maintainer's email address

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.23

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

*rw-0.7-r1 (03 Jun 2016)

  03 Jun 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> -rw-0.7.ebuild,
  +rw-0.7-r1.ebuild:
  new revision with EAPI=6 and ~x86 keywords.

  The main goal of the new revision is to add ~x86 keywords. In the
  process, the ebuild was updated to EAPI=6. That basically amounts
  to replacing the autotools-utils eclass stuff.

  25 Sep 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:

*rw-0.7-r2 (16 Oct 2016)

  16 Oct 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> -rw-0.7-r1.ebuild,
  +rw-0.7-r2.ebuild:
  new revision with a blocker on media-gfx/xpaint.

  We have a file collision (librw.so) with xpaint. Barring a better
  solution, we should at least block it in RDEPEND so that users don't
  see the collision. This new revision adds "!media-gfx/xpaint" to
  RDEPEND.

  Gentoo-Bug: 560210

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0
