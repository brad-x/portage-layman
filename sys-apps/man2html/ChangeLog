*man2html-1.6g (13 Feb 2016)

  13 Feb 2016; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>
  +files/man-1.6-cross-compile.patch,
  +files/man-1.6f-man2html-compression-2.patch,
  +files/man-1.6g-compress.patch, +man2html-1.6g.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  new package #519390

  With the migration to man-db, the man2html tool is no longer available
  as it was included with the canonical man package.  Create a dedicated
  package for this tool since some people want it w/man-db.
