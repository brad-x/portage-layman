  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*microcode-ctl-1.28-r1 (11 Aug 2015)

  +microcode-ctl-1.28-r1.ebuild:
  microcode-ctl: stop installing the init script

  Updating microcode on the fly is dangerous as it can modify the set of
  valid instructions.  An active example of this is Intel's TSX insns --
  the latest microcode push disables the insn on newer CPUs and causes
  SIGILL when you try to use it.  But if you test for the insn before the
  microcode is updated, it will execute fine.  For daemons that launched
  before the update, they'll find the flag works, and then crash later on
  when the insn no longer exists.

  Thus the only safe way to update microcode is at boot time via a builtin
  initramfs.  Details on this operation can be found in #528712#41.
