  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*suspend-1.0_p20150810 (13 Aug 2015)

  13 Aug 2015; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com>
  +suspend-1.0_p20150810.ebuild:
  fix bug 556954

  Fix build with fbsplash support in case when mediag-gfx/splashutils are
  compiled with media-libs/freetype support which is compiled with
  app-arch/bzip2 support.

  This issue is a combination of multiple bugs:

  1. media-gfx/splashutils provides incomplete list of libraries for
  static linking. See bug 408283.

  2. media-gfx/splashutils contains bogus entry in the list of
  static libraries. See bug 557126.

  3. suspend asks splashutils for a list of dynamic libs instead
  of static. This is fixed in this commit.
