  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

  +files/hexchat-2.12.2-configure.ac-remove-werror.patch,
  +hexchat-2.12.2-r1.ebuild, hexchat-9999.ebuild:
  fix libgdiplus.so & Werror errors

  Fixes the System.DllNotFounException: libgdiplus.so error when the
  theme-manager USE flag is set.  The problem is that only mono[minimal]
  is buildable right now, so mono[-minimal] does not work.  However,
  mono[minimal] does not pull in libgdiplus.so.  Therefore, the "fix" is
  to pull in libgdiplus as a dependency if the user is using
  mono[minimal].  Unfortunately, this doesn't fix the mono[-minimal] use
  case.

  Additionally, removes all Werror* flags from configure.ac.
