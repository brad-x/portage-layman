  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  claws-mail-3.12.0.ebuild, claws-mail-3.13.0.ebuild:
  Remove incorrect := operator on poppler

  Remove the use of := slot operator against app-text/poppler.
  The subslots in poppler indicate SONAME of libpoppler, while much more
  stable libpoppler-glib is used here.

  No revision bump is desired since the change makes it possible to
  avoid unnecessary rebuilds on following poppler upgrades, and it is
  going to apply after next poppler-induced rebuild anyway.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.23
