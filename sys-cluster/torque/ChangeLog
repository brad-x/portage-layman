  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  dependency cleanup

  Dependency atoms listed in the ebuild were rather significantly mis-matching
  what
  is actually linked to.  Cleaned them up, added slot and slot-operators as
  needed.

  Added libressl to IUSE but didn't test if libressl is a drop-in replacement
  for
  openssl -- the situation should be better either way since it was a magic
  dep
  until now.

  Also bumped EAPI for torque-2.x so it is no longer deprecated, and adjusted
  how
  the cpusets flag is added to configure.

*torque-6.0.1 (08 Jun 2016)

  08 Jun 2016; Ian Stakenvicius <axs@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  +torque-6.0.1.ebuild:
  introduce v6.0.1 with cgroups support

  So far there has been very little testing done with this version, and the
  in-ebuild
  cgroups support needs to be expanded (checks against kernel settings added,
  etc).

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28
