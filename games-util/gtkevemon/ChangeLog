  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*gtkevemon-1.10 (10 Aug 2016)

  10 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> +gtkevemon-1.10.ebuild,
  gtkevemon-9999.ebuild:
  new v1.10 and fix the repo for the live ebuild.

  The repository for this project changed (from Mercurial to Git), so
  the live ebuild needed to be updated. Thanks to Andre Schulz for
  posting an updated live ebuild. I also noticed that glibmm:3.0 and
  curl[ssl] have replaced glibmm:2.4 and openssl in the dependencies, so
  those have been updated as well.

  I added the new version 1.10, but all is not rosy there. The package
  builds fine, but I get SSLv3 errors when attempting to refresh
  SkillTree.xml and CertificateTree.xml. Building openssl with USE=sslv3
  does not fix this. Both new versions tell me that all of the servers
  are offline. For that reason, I have left v1.8 in the tree as well
  (just in case it works better for somebody).
