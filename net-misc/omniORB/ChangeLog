  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*omniORB-4.2.1_p2 (16 Aug 2016)

  16 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  +files/change-umask-from-002-to-022-in-CreateDir-macro.patch,
  +omniORB-4.2.1_p2.ebuild:
  new version using EAPI=6 and a few ebuild fixes.

  There has been a new version of this maintainer-needed package
  available for a while, and a user requested a version bump, so I've
  updated to the latest available stable release (bug 560680). In doing
  so, I added the missing PYTHON_DEPS and PYTHON_REQUIRED_USE from the
  python-single-r1 eclass (bug 547660). I also patched the build system
  to use a umask of 022 instead of 002 when creating directories, to fix
  compilation on systems with TPE (bug 576040).

  For the new version, the ebuild was updated to use EAPI=6. Some
  patches were dropped, as the fixes were merged upstream. IPv6 support
  was added with a straightforward $(use_with ipv6) call. Some errors
  were clarified, and some quoting adjusted -- minor housekeeping.
