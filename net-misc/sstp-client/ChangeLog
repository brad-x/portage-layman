  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*sstp-client-1.0.9-r2 (10 Jan 2016)

  10 Jan 2016; Michael Everitt <m.j.everitt@iee.org>
  +sstp-client-1.0.9-r2.ebuild:
  Fix for bug #567912.

  Fixes issue with net-misc/networkmanager-sstp, where connections are
  wrongly written to /var/lib/run/sstpc and networkmanager-sstp is looking
  in /run/sstpc. Adding --with-runtime-dir="/run/sstpc" to configure opts
  solves this issue.
  Inherit autotools, direct sed statement to makefile.am over Makefile.in.
  Ack to Coacher for various fixes & testing.
  Gentoo-Bug: 567912.
