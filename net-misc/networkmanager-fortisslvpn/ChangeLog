  New package

  Fortinet SSLVPN support for NetworkManager
  This requires the openfortivpn client installed

  The patch included is from upstream commit
  377ba9ca7fb33f3fb2ba5258a5af666869947597

  It makes sure that the temporary file that the plugin
  creates on connection is written in the correct place
  in /var/lib, it will fail on systemd systems otherwise.
