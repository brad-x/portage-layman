  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  dev-ml/*: Remove := slot ops from || deps, #586304

  23 Jun 2016; Alexis Ballier <aballier@gentoo.org>
  enumerate-111.08.00.ebuild:
  Revert "dev-ml/*: Remove := slot ops from || deps, #586304"

  This reverts commit 2d4ac687fbf44588f764697c9dcb2b960a18d51b.

  This commit is wrong in several aspects:
  - Such changes should come with a revbump
  - Removing := deps causes packages not to be rebuilt on upgrades, causing
    barely understandable build failures when upgrading, later on.
    Thanks to this commit, people that have installed those packages
    will likely experience those failures with the upcoming ocaml 4.03 unmask.
  - This is a non maintainer commit where no discussion at all happened with
  the
    maintainers during the 3 days between bug report and mass commit.
    Such discussion could have prevented the above mentioned breakage.

  Proper fix is to drop the backward compatibility part of the || () dep. This
  fix
  was slowly moving forward whenever possible and noticed. Main blocker for
  this is
  bug #463018 which requires taking extra care for not breaking the stable
  tree
  nor needlessly preventing future stabilization of packages.
