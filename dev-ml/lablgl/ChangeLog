  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  Revert DOCTYPE SYSTEM https changes in metadata.xml

  repoman does not yet accept the https version.
  This partially reverts eaaface92ee81f30a6ac66fe7acbcc42c00dc450.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

  dev-ml/*: Remove := slot ops from || deps, #586304

  21 Jun 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> lablgl-1.05.ebuild:
  Remove another := slot op from || dep

  23 Jun 2016; Alexis Ballier <aballier@gentoo.org> lablgl-1.05.ebuild:
  Revert "dev-ml/*: Remove := slot ops from || deps, #586304"

  This reverts commit 2d4ac687fbf44588f764697c9dcb2b960a18d51b.

  This commit is wrong in several aspects:
  - Such changes should come with a revbump
  - Removing := deps causes packages not to be rebuilt on upgrades, causing
    barely understandable build failures when upgrading, later on.
    Thanks to this commit, people that have installed those packages
    will likely experience those failures with the upcoming ocaml 4.03 unmask.
  - This is a non maintainer commit where no discussion at all happened with
  the
    maintainers during the 3 days between bug report and mass commit.
    Such discussion could have prevented the above mentioned breakage.

  Proper fix is to drop the backward compatibility part of the || () dep. This
  fix
  was slowly moving forward whenever possible and noticed. Main blocker for
  this is
  bug #463018 which requires taking extra care for not breaking the stable
  tree
  nor needlessly preventing future stabilization of packages.

*lablgl-1.05-r1 (23 Jun 2016)

  23 Jun 2016; Alexis Ballier <aballier@gentoo.org> +lablgl-1.05-r1.ebuild:
  drop backward compat deps on labltk/camlp4, bug #586304

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0_rc1

  25 Jun 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> lablgl-1.05-r1.ebuild:
  Copy stable keywords over for minor dep change, #586914

  29 Jun 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> lablgl-1.05.ebuild:
  Support camlp4/labltk in -r1 only, #586914

  Restrict the 1.05 ebuild to support old OCaml only to solve the :=-in-||
  problem. 1.05-r1 is stable on all architectures supporting camlp4,
  and -r0 is only kept for stable ia64 & sparc users.
