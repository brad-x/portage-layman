*antlr-cpp-2.7.7 (14 Oct 2015)

  14 Oct 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +antlr-cpp-2.7.7.ebuild,
  +files/2.7.7-gcc.patch, +files/2.7.7-libtool.patch, +metadata.xml:
  New package, split from dev-java/antlr

  The old ANTLR 2 ebuild tried to cram all the runtimes together, which
  was messy. The C++ runtime does not need any Java components at build
  time or runtime so it makes sense to split this out. The C++ runtime
  for ANTLR 4 is maintained separately by upstream anyway.

  This new package does a better job of building the shared library with
  the help of libtool. It also supports multilib.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1

  25 Dec 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> antlr-cpp-2.7.7.ebuild:
  Fix src_test breakage, closes bug #569230

  There actually aren't any tests but the test target blows up.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26
