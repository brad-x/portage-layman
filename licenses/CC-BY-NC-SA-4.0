in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

s Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality r
ights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to

 use of the Licensed Material:

    for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
 reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
 database for NonCommercial purposes only;
    if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a da
tabase in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which
 You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapt
ed Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
    You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a su
bstantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
 obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other C
opyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possib
le, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes

hether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
 warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-inf
ringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or abse
nce of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warran
ties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
    To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on an
y legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any 
direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or ot
her losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or us
e of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibi
lity of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liabilit
y is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

    The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shal
l be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approxim
ates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

    This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
 licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Yo
ur rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

    Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6
(a), it reinstates:
        automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cure
d within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
        upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the 
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
    For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Materia
l under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material 
at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

icensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Publi
c License.
    To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed un
enforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary 
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
 from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining 
terms and conditions.
    No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to
 comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

tion upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licenso
r or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
