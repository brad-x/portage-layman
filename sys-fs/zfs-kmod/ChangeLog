  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  0.6.5-r1: Fix discard corruption regression

  This is the first data corruption bug in the history of the ZoL project
  and I regret to say that it is my fault. I wrote the patch that caused
  it and it went into HEAD after passing upstream review. It affects Linux
  2.6.36 and later.

  +zfs-kmod-0.6.5.2.ebuild, zfs-kmod-9999.ebuild:
  sys-fs/zfs and friends: bump to 0.6.5.2

  Upstream release notes:

  https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-0.6.5.2

  Some additional improvements were made to the ebuilds in this bump.

  1. The incorrect requirement on BLK_DEV_LOOP was removed from sys-fs/zfs-
  kmod
  in favor of a cups ebuild style warning in sys-fs/zfs when BLK_DEV_LOOP is
  not
  avaliable and the test suite has been installed.

  2. The regression where we remove the dracut module has been fixed.

  3. The failure to migrate users to the zfs-zed script from the zed script
  has
  been fixed.

  4. The 9999 ebuilds have been synchronized with the 0.6.5.2 ebuilds.

  5. The sys-fs/zfs-kmod-0.6.5 has been removed due to the regression that
  prompted sys-fs/zfs-kmod-0.6.5-r1.

*zfs-kmod-0.6.5.3-r1 (03 Dec 2015)

  03 Dec 2015; Richard Yao <ryao@gentoo.org> +zfs-kmod-0.6.5.3-r1.ebuild:
  sys-kernel/spl + sys-fs/zfs{,-kmod}: Partial stable /dev/zfs API + backports

  This backports various fixes and also implements the partial /dev/zfs
  stable API that I have developed at ClusterHQ over the past 14 months.
  Ordinarily, I would not commit something like this until it has gone
  upstream, but upstream wants review from people in the Illumos project
  that prefer to see things like this in production before it reaches them
  and it would have likely been deadlocked until I volunteered Gentoo.

  I am confident that this is ready for production and I believe Gentoo
  benefits from it enough to justify being the first production user.
  Unless the API changes under review, situations where the kernel modules
  and userland bits fall out of sync will no longer break the boot process
  (excluding zfs-share and zfs-zed).  This was the longstanding blocker to
  the ebuilds moving from ~arch to arch, so we could finally see that
  happen around later this month / early next month.

  Fixes regressions in the code from the proposed stable API branch and an old
  regression that caused `zpool create -m none -t ...` to fail to set the
  mountpoint and certain other properties. That only occurred when the
  ZFSOnLinux
  specific -t argument is set.

  The stable API patches from the 0.6.5.3-r4 ebuild and fix for the
  temporary pool names have been carried forward in 0.6.5.4-r1. 0.6.5.4
  has been commited without any patches as an aid to users who do not want
  patches. However, it is left unkeyworded to ensure the upgrade path is
  smooth.

  The updated patchset has been delayed due to some matters that I am in

  keywords for the people who want it sooner.
