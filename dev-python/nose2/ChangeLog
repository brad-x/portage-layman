*nose2-0.6.4 (27 Mar 2016)

  27 Mar 2016; Alex Brandt <alunduil@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +nose2-0.6.4.ebuild:
  add version 0.6.4

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

  27 Mar 2016; Alex Brandt <alunduil@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  add type to maintainer tag in metadata

  I still wonder why the vim template doesn't include this in its
  generation of metadata.xml but it can continue to wait.  Also, why does
  repoman commit break the automatic linebreaking done by vim in commit
  messages?

  Looks like ft=conf instead of the normal commit type?

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28
