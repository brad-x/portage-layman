  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)
