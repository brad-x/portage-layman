  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

  29 May 2016; Anthony Ryan <anthonyryan1@gmail.com> oct2py-3.3.3.ebuild:
  HTTPS (and canonicalize domain) for github.com

  All links to www.github.com were changed to github.com (preferred by
  GitHub).

  During the automated testing of all modified packages the following SRC_URIs
  were discovered to have changed upstream. Upon closer inspection they were
  all confirmed to not be regressions. They will all continue to work when
  served from the mirrors.

  * dev-python/catkin_pkg-0.2.10 (upstream tarball changed)
  * dev-python/rosdistro-0.4.4 (upstream tarball changed)
  * dev-util/rosdep-0.11.4 (upstream tarball changed)
  * dev-util/wstool-0.1.12 (upstream tarball changed)
  * dev-util/wstool-0.1.13 (upstream tarball changed)
  * dev-util/rosdep-0.11.5 (upstream tarball deleted)
