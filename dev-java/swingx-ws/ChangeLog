*swingx-ws-1.0_p20110515 (13 Feb 2016)
*swingx-ws-1.0 (13 Feb 2016)

  13 Feb 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +swingx-ws-1.0.ebuild, +swingx-ws-1.0_p20110515.ebuild:
  New package, required by bt747

  BT747 actually maintains its own incompatible fork, which I have
  included here in the bt747 SLOT. I would have put this in a separate
  package but the original project is long dead so that variant will
  safely remain at 1.0 forever.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.27
