  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  -gcj-jdk-4.8.4.ebuild, +gcj-jdk-4.8.4-r1.ebuild, -gcj-jdk-4.9.2.ebuild,
  +gcj-jdk-4.9.3.ebuild, metadata.xml:
  Respect eselect-ecj, drop 4.7, bump 4.9, other fixes

   * The ecj-gcj SLOT was previously hardcoded but it still used the
     version eselected at build time. Now it will resolve at runtime.
   * 4.7 is no longer needed as we have dropped ia64 support.
   * 4.9 has been bumped from 4.9.2. to 4.9.3.
   * Paths have been fixed for prefixed systems.
   * X flag has changed to awt to better reflect what it does.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1
