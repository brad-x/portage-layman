*boot-bin-2.6.0 (04 Sep 2016)

  04 Sep 2016; Kent Fredric <kentnl@gentoo.org> +boot-bin-2.6.0.ebuild,
  +files/boot, +metadata.xml:
  Added at 2.6.0

  This is mostly just giving users a better choice than "sudo bash curl..."

  boot will still have to install its own dependencies when executed via maven
  glue into ~/.m2/, but this still means they can easily get `boot` accessible
  globally in "$PATH" without security paranoia, and from then on it
  "mostly just works" without needing to understand boot-specific install
  procedures.

  Ideally this itself will be built from sources one day, but java upstream
  logic fights this at every stage.

  Also, "boot -u" still does "something", but it doesn't do anything useful.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0
