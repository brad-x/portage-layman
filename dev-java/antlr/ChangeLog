  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*antlr-2.7.7-r7 (14 Oct 2015)

  14 Oct 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +antlr-2.7.7-r7.ebuild:
  v2 ebuild that only builds the tool and Java runtime

  The old ANTLR 2 ebuild tried to cram all the runtimes together, which
  was messy. The C++ runtime has been split into dev-cpp/antlr-cpp. The
  other runtimes have been dropped due to lack of use. v2 is really
  ancient anyway.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1

  14 Oct 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> -antlr-2.7.7-r6.ebuild:
  Remove old

  I believe bug #555300, which created 2.7.7-r6, was bogus anyway.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1

*antlr-3.2 (05 Dec 2015)

  05 Dec 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +antlr-3.2.ebuild,
  +files/3.2-java-8.patch, +files/3.2-test-fixes.patch:
  Version bump for SLOT 3, should fix #567560

  I initially wanted to add 3.3 but despite it being less disruptive
  than 3.4, I found compatibility issues with the revdeps. We will
  hopefully never need 3.3.

  This is a total rewrite from the previous version, which uses the new
  simplified antlr-2 ebuild and adds a very large test suite that is
  passing with a little patching.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

*antlr-3.5.2 (05 Dec 2015)

  05 Dec 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +antlr-3.5.2.ebuild,
  +files/3.5.2-test-fixes.patch:
  Version bump into new SLOT 3.5

  Primarily needed to unbundle ANTLR 4. This release seems to have more
  in common with 4 than it does with 3.2, hence the new SLOT.

  I have excluded the output=template feature to draw a firm dividing
  line between 0/3 and 3.5/4 SLOTs, otherwise 4 would pull in 3 previous
  versions!

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

*antlr-4.5.1 (06 Dec 2015)

  06 Dec 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +antlr-4.5.1.ebuild:
  Version bump to 4.5.1 (closes bug #545384)

  This is a rewrite as the 4.4 ebuild bundled a lot of prebuilt stuff
  and didn't include any tests. gunit support has been dropped because
  no one uses it and it is not worth the hassle.

  Nothing in the tree truly needs at present this as the existing
  dependencies are bogus but no doubt something will before long.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26
