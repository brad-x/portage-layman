  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*jflex-1.6.1 (02 Nov 2015)

  02 Nov 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +files/icedtea-arm.patch,
  +jflex-1.6.1.ebuild:
  Rewrite for version bump to 1.6.1

  Rewritten using java-pkg-simple to give us more control over this
  tricky package. javacup has become a PDEPEND, meaning that the bundled
  version is automatically used on the first build instead of it having
  a system-jflex USE flag.

  ~arm keyword added with workarounds for different problems encountered
  with both IcedTea and Oracle.

  ~ppc64 keyword temporarily dropped until it gets Java 7, which the
  newer javacup requires.

  Please stabilise this at the same time as dev-java/qdox-1.12.1-r1.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1
