  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  3.0: New release

  -Updated HOMEPAGE and SRC_URI

  29 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> -piccolo2d-1.2.1-r2.ebuild:
  Remove old

  This drops the only stable version but it doesn't build at all now
  (was sun.dc part of the JDK before?) and it currently has no revdeps.

  The new version should probably have been put in a different SLOT but
  that doesn't matter now that the old version is going.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.27

  30 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> -piccolo2d-3.0.ebuild,
  +piccolo2d-3.0-r1.ebuild:
  Use SWT 3.8 instead of 3.7

  Might as well use the newer version since it seems to work. I tried
  the SWT examples.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.27
