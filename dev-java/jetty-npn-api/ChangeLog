*jetty-npn-api-1.1.1 (07 Apr 2016)

  07 Apr 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +jetty-npn-api-1.1.1.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  New package, required by netty-handler

  Thanks to wltjr for the original ebuild. Annoyingly the GitHub
  repository for this has vanished, probably because it is deprecated.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28
