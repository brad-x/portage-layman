*maven-hawtjni-plugin-1.11 (07 Apr 2016)

  07 Apr 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org>
  +maven-hawtjni-plugin-1.11.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  New package, resources only

  We currently don't use Maven in ebuilds and we haven't found the need
  to build the many plugins. This one has useful resource files for
  building netty-tcnative and potentially other native libraries.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28
