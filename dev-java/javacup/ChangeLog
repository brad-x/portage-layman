  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*javacup-0.11b_p20151001 (02 Nov 2015)

  02 Nov 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org>
  +javacup-0.11b_p20151001.ebuild:
  Rewrite for version bump to 0.11b_p20151001

  Dropped the beta label as the previous version was not really a beta.

  No longer has a system-jflex USE flag now that jflex has javacup as a
  PDEPEND. This is better as users were unlikely to ever set this flag
  and a system version of javacup will be used automatically when it
  becomes available.

  ~arm keyword restored and ~ppc64 keyword temporarily dropped as Java 7
  is required now.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1

  18 Nov 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org>
  javacup-0.11b_p20151001.ebuild:
  Use installed javacup over bundled where possible

  Fixes bug #565338.

  Annoyingly javacup bundles an older version of itself that will break
  jflex if that has already been built against this newer version
  beforehand. Even more annoyingly, the binary download is built with
  Java 8, which isn't much use to us. We therefore use any installed
  javacup that is newer than the bundled version where possible. If this
  approach turns out to be unworkable then we may just have to use the
  bundled jflex for bootstrapping.
