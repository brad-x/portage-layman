*leiningen-bin-2.7.0 (02 Sep 2016)

  02 Sep 2016; Kent Fredric <kentnl@gentoo.org> +files/leinrc,
  +leiningen-bin-2.7.0.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  Added to tree at v=2.7.0

  Initial binary-only version, because this packages workflow
  requires itself for building, and does a lot of auto-magic

  Bug: https://bugs.gentoo.org/485270

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0
