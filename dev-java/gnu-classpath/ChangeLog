  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  EAPI bump, dependency clean up, doc fixes

   * Apply slot operators where appropriate.

   * Actually install the docs.

*gnu-classpath-0.98-r5 (10 Jan 2016)

  10 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org>
  -gnu-classpath-0.98-r4.ebuild, +gnu-classpath-0.98-r5.ebuild:
  Build with regular javac instead of ECJ

  I believe GNU Classpath favoured ECJ because it was the only FOSS
  compiler capable of building it at the time. OpenJDK is now preferable
  and the statement in configure.ac that not using ECJ results in
  com.sun.tools.javac not being included doesn't hold true.

  The simplification is nice but this also avoids a race condition
  occuring with ECJ on ppc. This is almost certainly a CACAO issue. See
  http://icedtea.classpath.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2782.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

  14 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org>
  gnu-classpath-0.98-r5.ebuild:
  Mark 0.98-r5 stable on behalf of arch teams

  Needs to be done in conjunction with other changes so I am doing the
  commit with their permission.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

  14 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org>
  -gnu-classpath-0.98-r3.ebuild:
  Remove old

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

  16 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org>
  gnu-classpath-0.98-r5.ebuild:
  Drop support for Java on ppc across the tree

  Sorry! *sniff*

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

  -files/gnu-classpath-0.98-r3-freetype-2.5.3-support.patch:
