*assertj-core-2.3.0 (17 Jan 2016)

  17 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +assertj-core-2.3.0.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  New package, needed by latest testng's tests

  No tests on this one for now due to missing dependencies. This isn't
  the newest version but I don't know whether 3.x is compatible and it
  also requires Java 8, which might be inconvenient at present.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

  14 Mar 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> assertj-core-2.3.0.ebuild:
  2.3.0 stable on amd64 and x86 using ALLARCHES

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28
