  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  +oracle-jdk-bin-1.8.0.60.ebuild:
  Version bump wrt bug #558102

  This introduces support for arm64. Thanks to "shinydoofy" for the
  patch. Unfortunately I don't have hardware to test this on.

  -oracle-jdk-bin-1.8.0.60.ebuild, +oracle-jdk-bin-1.8.0.60-r1.ebuild:
  Delete Oracle's evil usage tracker

  Fixes bug #559478. Their site says it's disabled by default but that
  doesn't appear to be the case any more.

  -oracle-jdk-bin-1.8.0.60-r1.ebuild, +oracle-jdk-bin-1.8.0.60-r2.ebuild:
  Remove PostVMInitHook to stop usage tracker

  Deleting the usage tracker resulted in exceptions being silently
  raised in a thread and this caused havoc with debuggers. Deleting the
  hook that calls it instead is a smaller change and avoids both
  problems.

  It is possible that Oracle may use this hook for something else later.
  I have therefore added a JAVA_PKG_STRICT check to display its contents
  on each merge so that we can keep an eye on it.

  See bug #559936 for more details.

  Fix hardened + JAVA_PKG_STRICT breakage

  We need to PaX mark javap before we run it on hardened systems.

  awt flag, nsplugin, javapackager

   * Change awt USE flag to !headless-awt
   * Install nsplugin to /usr/lib/nsbrowser/plugins in line with
     eselect-java and icedtea-web changes
   * Don't install javapackager unless javafx is enabled (#565828)

  Sorry for changing the X/awt flag again but icedtea upstream preferred
  the term headless, which is technically more accurate than awt, so I
  compromised and went with headless-awt. This isn't icedtea but
  consistency is king and I may apply this flag to virtual/jre one day.
