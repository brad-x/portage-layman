  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*jdom-2.0.6-r1 (25 Aug 2015)

  25 Aug 2015; Patrice Clement <monsieurp@gentoo.org> +jdom-2.0.6-r1.ebuild:
  Do away with the hacks and rewrite this ebuild from scratch using java-pkg-
  simple. Doing so, this eclass is now generating the documentation for free.
  Fixes 551700.

*jdom-2.0.6-r4 (27 Aug 2015)

  27 Aug 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +files/build-xml-2.patch,
  -jdom-2.0.6-r1.ebuild, -jdom-2.0.6-r2.ebuild, -jdom-2.0.6-r3.ebuild,
  +jdom-2.0.6-r4.ebuild:
  Another rewrite of the v2 ebuild using Ant

  Here comes a new challenger! I got sick of monsieurp and wltjr arguing
  about this package so I decided to outdo them both. :) It was awkward
  to build before because they had missed the build.xml file present on
  GitHub.

   * All tests now pass.
   * RDEPEND on junit removed.
   * Unnecessary xml-commons-external dependency removed.
   * License changed as "JDOM" is basically just Apache-1.1.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1

  29 Sep 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> jdom-1.1.3.ebuild:
  Added ~arm keyword, jdom-1.0-r4 had it and others

  This is the same codebase, the stable version, thus should be fine on
  as the older version was. Hasn't been tested though, no arm
  hardware. Fixes QA dep issues for latest version of dev-java/saxon
  keyworded for ~arm.

  29 Sep 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> -jdom-1.0_beta9-r2.ebuild,

  -jdom-1.0_beta10-r6.ebuild:
  Removed older beta versions

  Still need to remove 1.0 versions once other ebuilds with updated
  slots get marked stable, leaving just 1.1.x versions behind
  eventually.

  06 Jan 2016; Patrice Clement <monsieurp@gentoo.org> jdom-1.1.3.ebuild:
