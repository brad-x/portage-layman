*myspell-kk-1.1.2 (01 Nov 2016)

  01 Nov 2016; Ulrich MÃ¼ller <ulm@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +myspell-kk-1.1.2.ebuild:
  QA] Package renamed from hunspell-kk.

  Ebuild rewritten from scratch, based on work by Galym Kerimbekov.

  Note that this is not a pkgmove because we don't want to "burn"
  hunspell-kk as a package name, for the case that myspell-* would be
  moved to hunspell-* later.

  Bug: 586788

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.2
