  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Remove explicit notion of maintainer-needed, for GLEP 67

  GLEP 67 removes the explicit notion of maintainer-needed@g.o being used
  for packages lacking maintainers, in favor of assuming maintainer-needed
  whenever the package has no maintainers.

  28 Feb 2016; Ulrich Müller <ulm@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  metadata.xml: Add maintainer-needed comment to packages without maintainer.

  Bug: 575810

*wordnet-3.0-r5 (26 Jul 2016)

  26 Jul 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  +files/wordnet-3.0-fix-indexing-bug-314799.patch, +wordnet-3.0-r5.ebuild:
  new revision fixing two bugs.

  This package is unmaintained and has two open bugs. The first has a
  patch, thanks to Edgar Gonzàlez i Pellicer, which fixes a problem
  introduced by an earlier patch. It is now applied. The second bug
  reports that the package's SRC_URI is no longer valid, so I have
  updated it from the homepage.

  The ebuild was updated to EAPI=6 in the process. This allowed the
  removal of multilib.eclass in exchange for a call to eapply_user.
