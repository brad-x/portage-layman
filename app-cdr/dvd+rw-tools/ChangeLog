  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  +files/dvd+rw-tools-7.0-sysmacros.patch:
  fix build w/newer glibc

*dvd+rw-tools-7.1-r2 (31 Jul 2016)

  31 Jul 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> +dvd+rw-tools-7.1-r2.ebuild,
  +files/dvd+rw-tools-7.0-dvddl-r1.patch,
  +files/dvd+rw-tools-7.0-wctomb-r1.patch:
  new revision with EAPI=6 to fix a bug.

  A new revision was in order to fix bug 440426 and only show a ulimit
  warning for new installs. It made sense to update to EAPI=6 for the
  new revision, and that simplified the ebuild a bit. To use the EAPI=6
  PATCHES support, two patches had to be revisioned to be -p1
  compatible.  Theoretically they could have been modified in-place
  (since epatch autodetects the -pN level), but since that would affect
  a stable ebuild, I avoided it.

  Gentoo-Bug: 440426
