*fast_yaml-1.0.3 (07 Jun 2016)

  07 Jun 2016; Amadeusz Żołnowski <aidecoe@gentoo.org>
  +fast_yaml-1.0.3.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  Add new package

  It is debundled from net-im/ejabberd-16.04 and therefore inherits
  keywords from ejabberd: ~amd64, ~arm, ~ppc and ~x86. ~ia64 and ~sparc
  are not inherited because other dependency is missing these keywords and
  there's no chance it can get them any time soon.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0_rc1

  03 Jul 2016; Amadeusz Żołnowski <aidecoe@gentoo.org> fast_yaml-1.0.3.ebuild:
  dev-erlang: Add ~ia64 and ~sparc keywords back

  These packages have been debundled from ejabberd which used to have
  ~ia64 ~sparc keywords. These had to be removed temporarily until
  dev-util/rebar has these keywords.

  20 Aug 2016; Matthias Maier <tamiko@gentoo.org> fast_yaml-1.0.3.ebuild:
  stabilize 1.0.3 on amd64/x86, bug #587908

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28
