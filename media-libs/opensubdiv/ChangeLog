  New package

  OpenSubdiv is a set of open source libraries that implement high
  performance subdivision surface (subdiv) evaluation on massively
  parallel CPU and GPU architectures. This code path is optimized
  for drawing deforming surfaces with static topology at
  interactive framerates.

  OpenSubdiv is an API ready to be integrated into 3rd party
  digital content creation tools. It is not an application, nor a
  tool that can be used directly to create digital assets.
