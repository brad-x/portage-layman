*openh264-1.2_p20141104 (04 Dec 2014)

  04 Dec 2014; Ian Stakenvicius (_AxS_) <axs@gentoo.org>
  +openh264-1.2_p20141104.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  Initial commit. Upstream doesn't release distfiles nor do they release
  versions in a particularily reliable manner, so packages will be snapshots
  for the time being. Note also that the mozilla prefs overrides will not
  forcibly install at a later version, however a script needs to be written to
  synchronize their installation.
