*ptex-2.1.28 (22 Oct 2016)

  22 Oct 2016; David Seifert <soap@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +ptex-2.1.28.ebuild:
  New package

  Ptex is a texture mapping system developed by Walt Disney Animation
  Studios for production-quality rendering:

  - No UV assignment is required! Ptex applies a separate texture to
    each face of a subdivision or polygon mesh.
  - The Ptex file format can efficiently store hundreds of thousands
    of texture images in a single file.
  - The Ptex API provides cached file I/O and high-quality filtering:
    everything that is needed to easily add Ptex support to a
    production-quality renderer or texture authoring application.
