  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*makemkv-1.9.8-r1 (27 Dec 2015)

  27 Dec 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +files/makemkv-qt4.patch,
  +files/makemkv-qt5.patch, -makemkv-1.9.8.ebuild, +makemkv-1.9.8-r1.ebuild:
  Add Qt5 support, closes bug #569768

  Qt5 always trumps Qt4 if it is available. There are no configure
  options or variables to control this and there is no publicly
  available configure.ac either so we have to selectively patch the raw
  configure script directly.

  Also make a couple of simplifications. src_configure checked for a
  configure script even though there is always one there now. I also
  couldn't see any reason for having virtual/opengl as a dependency.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

*makemkv-1.9.9 (19 Jan 2016)

  19 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> -makemkv-1.9.8-r1.ebuild,
  +makemkv-1.9.9.ebuild:
  Version bump

  Not fully tested as I'm at work!
