  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*makemkv-1.9.8-r1 (27 Dec 2015)

  27 Dec 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +files/makemkv-qt4.patch,
  +files/makemkv-qt5.patch, -makemkv-1.9.8.ebuild, +makemkv-1.9.8-r1.ebuild:
  Add Qt5 support, closes bug #569768

  Qt5 always trumps Qt4 if it is available. There are no configure
  options or variables to control this and there is no publicly
  available configure.ac either so we have to selectively patch the raw
  configure script directly.

  Also make a couple of simplifications. src_configure checked for a
  configure script even though there is always one there now. I also
  couldn't see any reason for having virtual/opengl as a dependency.

*makemkv-1.9.9 (19 Jan 2016)

  19 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> -makemkv-1.9.8-r1.ebuild,
  +makemkv-1.9.9.ebuild:
  Version bump

  Not fully tested as I'm at work!

  +makemkv-1.9.10.ebuild:
  Bump to 1.9.10, EAPI 6, minor fixes

  08 May 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> makemkv-1.9.10.ebuild:
  Use the l10n eclass to select locales

  Upstream uses non-standard locale names so map them with an
  associative array and perform some tricks.

  Thanks to Jan Chren for the initial work on this.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

  08 May 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org>
  +files/makemkv-sysmacros.patch, makemkv-1.9.10.ebuild:
  Patch implicit inclusion of sysmacros.h, #580342

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

  08 May 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> files/makemkv-path.patch,
  makemkv-1.9.10.ebuild:
  Launch executables from the PATH

  Upstream launches wget as /usr/bin/wget and uses a hardcoded set of
  paths to search for other executables. All the required executables
  should be in the PATH anyway and this will fix prefixed systems.

  Also add missing dependency on wget. It's in @system but it's one of
  the less obvious entries.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

  08 May 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> makemkv-1.9.10.ebuild:
  Install everything to /usr, not some to /opt

  makemkvcon looks for files in ../share/MakeMKV. Installing them to
  /opt/share/MakeMKV is a bit weird and using /opt requires patching so
  it's not exactly supported by upstream.

  This means installing prebuilt binaries to /usr but we were previously
  having to install a freshly-built binary to /opt so we're screwing FHS
  either way. ;)

*makemkv-1.10.0 (24 Jul 2016)

  24 Jul 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> -makemkv-1.9.10.ebuild,
  +makemkv-1.10.0.ebuild:
  Version bump to 1.10.0, undo locales, amend Qt

  The locale flags were a nice idea but Gentoo is moving away from
  LINGUAS-based USE flags. These will be replaced by L10N-based flags
  but not for this particular use case. The new INSTALL_MASK mechanism
  won't support the non-standard locations used by this package. We may
  as well just install them all as they only take up 150KB.

  Also prefer qt5 over qt4 without REQUIRED_USE in accordance with
  Gentoo's Qt policy.
