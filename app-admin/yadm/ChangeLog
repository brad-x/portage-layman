  30 Apr 2016; Sam Jorna <wraeth@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml, +yadm-1.04.ebuild:
  new package

  yadm is a dotfile manager that handles the hassle of synchronizing the
  dotfiles in your home folder across different workstations. It has a
  philosophy using git and getting out of git's way to ensure it does what
  it does best.

  Maintainer assigned to Espen H per request under Proxy Maintainers.
