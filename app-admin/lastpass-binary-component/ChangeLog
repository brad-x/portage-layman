*lastpass-binary-component-4.1.2 (22 Apr 2016)

  22 Apr 2016; Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>
  +lastpass-binary-component-4.1.2.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  new package #571280

  This is a split off from app-admin/lastpass and only installs the binary
  component required by the browser extension, as opposed to installing
  the extension too. Beginning with lastpass-4, the upstream only
  installs the binary component.

  Also, add this package as a blocker for app-admin/lastpass. These two
  packages cannot be installed at the same time as that would introduce
  file collisions.
