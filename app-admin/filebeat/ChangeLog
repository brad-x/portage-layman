*filebeat-1.3.1 (24 Oct 2016)

  24 Oct 2016; Patrice Clement <monsieurp@gentoo.org> +filebeat-1.3.1.ebuild,
  +files/filebeat.confd, +files/filebeat.initd, +metadata.xml:
  new package.

  Filebeat is part of the Beats family by Elasticsearch. It's a lightweight
  log
  forwarder to Logstash & Elasticsearch.

  We already have a binary version of the package in tree, but this non-binary
  should eventually remove it.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.1
  Closes: https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/2585
  Signed-off-by: Patrice Clement <monsieurp@gentoo.org>
