  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  sys-fs/zfs and friends: bump to 0.6.5.2

  Upstream release notes:

  https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-0.6.5.2

  Some additional improvements were made to the ebuilds in this bump.

  1. The incorrect requirement on BLK_DEV_LOOP was removed from sys-fs/zfs-
  kmod
  in favor of a cups ebuild style warning in sys-fs/zfs when BLK_DEV_LOOP is
  not
  avaliable and the test suite has been installed.

  2. The regression where we remove the dracut module has been fixed.

  3. The failure to migrate users to the zfs-zed script from the zed script
  has
  been fixed.

  4. The 9999 ebuilds have been synchronized with the 0.6.5.2 ebuilds.

  5. The sys-fs/zfs-kmod-0.6.5 has been removed due to the regression that
  prompted sys-fs/zfs-kmod-0.6.5-r1.

  Upstream no longer depends on this.

*spl-0.6.5.3-r1 (03 Dec 2015)

  03 Dec 2015; Richard Yao <ryao@gentoo.org> +spl-0.6.5.3-r1.ebuild:
  sys-fs/zfs{,-kmod}: Partial stable /dev/zfs API + backports

  This backports various fixes and also implements the partial /dev/zfs
  stable API that I have developed at ClusterHQ over the past 14 months.
  Ordinarily, I would not commit something like this until it has gone
  upstream, but upstream wants review from people in the Illumos project
  that prefer to see things like this in production before it reaches them
  and it would have likely been deadlocked until I volunteered Gentoo.

  I am confident that this is ready for production and I believe Gentoo
  benefits from it enough to justify being the first production user.
  Unless the API changes under review, situations where the kernel modules
  and userland bits fall out of sync will no longer break the boot process
  (excluding zfs-share and zfs-zed).  This was the longstanding blocker to
  the ebuilds moving from ~arch to arch, so we could finally see that
  happen around later this month / early next month.

  Drop PAX_SIZE_OVERFLOW req and add RANDSTRUCT

  PAX_SIZE_OVERFLOW has been fixed in this version so is no longer required.
  Fails to compile when GRKERNSEC_RANDSTRUCT is enabled.

  16 Jan 2016; Richard Yao <ryao@gentoo.org> spl-0.6.3-r1.ebuild:
  0.6.3-r1: Drop !PAX_RANDKSTACK (bug #532992)

  This was erroneously enabled following miscommunication with the
  hardened team. It was removed from all other ebuilds except
  sys-kernel/spl-0.6.3-r1.

  8573dd@gmail.com filed #532992 on it, which is now being resolved as
  part of a sweep of old bugs that were previously neglected due to a mix
  of a lack of time to do a final check and the belief that they had been
  resolved.

  sys-fs/spl-0.6.5.4{,-r1}: Version Bump

  The patches from the 0.6.5.3-r1 ebuild that were not backported
  upstream have been carried forward in 0.6.5.4-r1. 0.6.5.4 has been
  commited without any patches as an aid to users who do not want
  patches. However, it is left unkeyworded to be consistent with the
  sys-fs/zfs-kmod ebuild.

  9999: Update kernel config reqs for grsec

  compatibility with Grsec's HIDESYM has been fixed in a few released versions
  already. RANDSTRUCT causes compile failures.

  They are correct in the latest release ebuild but the live ebuild was
  out of sync.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

*spl-0.6.5.6 (16 Apr 2016)

  16 Apr 2016; Richard Yao <ryao@gentoo.org> +spl-0.6.5.6.ebuild:
  sys-fs/zfs and friends: bump to 0.6.5.6 (unkeyworded)

  The updated patchset has been delayed due to some matters that I am in
  the process of resolving. I am committing the 0.6.5.6 ebuilds without
  keywords for the people who want it sooner.

  up to kernel 4.8 compatibility, acked by maintainer

  Keyword sys-fs/zfs and friends for ~amd64

  We are abandoning the /dev/zfs API stabilization effort in Gentoo until
  it is merged by upstream because stronger QA tests are causing it to
  hold us back.
