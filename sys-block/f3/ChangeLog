  New package

  The "Fight Flash Fraud" or "Fight Fake Flash" tool represents
  a GPLv3 implementation of the algorithm of h2testw and further
  improvements to speed up the identification of fake drives
  as well as making them usable.

  You can also use these utilities if you want to test the
  integrity of your USB/flash medium.
