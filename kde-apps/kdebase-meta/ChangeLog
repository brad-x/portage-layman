  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  +kdebase-meta-4.14.3-r1.ebuild:
  Cleanup, adjust RDEPENDs

  Opt. RDEPEND to remove blocker w/ kde-plasma/plasma-workspace-wallpapers:
  kde-apps/kde-wallpapers:5

  Make sure of upgrade to non-blocking and fixed package versions:
  kde-apps/konsole-4.14.3-r1
  kde-base/kcheckpass-4.11.22-r1

*kdebase-meta-4.14.3-r2 (04 Jan 2016)

  -kdebase-meta-4.14.3-r1.ebuild, +kdebase-meta-4.14.3-r2.ebuild:
  kde-apps/konsolepart: Add it as alternative dependency to konsole:4

  05 Jan 2016; Michael Palimaka <kensington@gentoo.org>
  kdebase-meta-4.14.3-r2.ebuild:
  avoid pulling in konsole:5

  Portage sees it as an upgrade so the LHS/RHS intention didn't work.
