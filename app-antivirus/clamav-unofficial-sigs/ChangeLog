  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*clamav-unofficial-sigs-4.5.3 (24 Aug 2015)

  24 Aug 2015; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  +clamav-unofficial-sigs-4.5.3.ebuild:
  Major version bump to v4.5.3.

  Upstream has been taken over (in a friendly sense) by the team at
  eXtremeSHOK.com, so the HOMEPAGE and SRC_URI have changed
  accordingly. The config file has changed significantly, so users will
  need to revisit their configs.

*clamav-unofficial-sigs-5.0.6 (06 Apr 2016)

  +clamav-unofficial-sigs-5.0.6.ebuild:
  add new version 5.0.6.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

*clamav-unofficial-sigs-5.3.1 (15 May 2016)

  15 May 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  -clamav-unofficial-sigs-5.0.6.ebuild, +clamav-unofficial-sigs-5.3.1.ebuild,
  +files/clamav-unofficial-sigs.8, +files/clamav-unofficial-sigs.logrotate:
  replace v5.0.6 with v5.3.1.

  A few ebuild changes were necessary. First, the man page and logrotate
  scripts have gone away and have been replaced with a hokey procedure
  to generate them (that we can't use in the ebuild). To keep things
  working, we now ship pre-generated copies of those two files. We also
  install the user.conf file which is a no-op out-of-the-box. My own
  changes to os.gentoo.conf upstream now allow us to use the default
  src_prepare().

  Thanks are due to Tobias Sager who reported the new version and
  supplied the necessary fixes.
