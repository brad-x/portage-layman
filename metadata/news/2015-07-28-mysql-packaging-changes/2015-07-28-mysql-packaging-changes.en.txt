The upcoming versions of MySQL packages will see a change with the
introduction of a new virtual, libmysqlclient and USE flag adjustments.

The existing virtual/mysql will represent the server (mysqld) and
tools (mysqldump, mysql, mysqladmin, etc) while virtual/libmysqlclient
will represent the mysql client shared and static libraries, e.g.
libmysqlclient.so.

Ebuilds that only link the libraries may not pull in the server
packages with this change in the future. Because of this, you may have
to add a virtual/mysql or one of the providers; i.e. dev-db/mysql,
dev-db/mariadb, or dev-db/percona-server; to your world file if you
require a server to be installed locally.  This will be phased in
slowly as other packages are updated.

As for the server packages themselves, the "minimal" USE is being
replaced. The new USE flags are client-libs, server, and tools.
The server and tools flags are on by default to signify the primary
purpose of those builds.

The primary provider for libraries will be a new package
dev-db/mysql-connector-c.  Thorough testing did not turn up any
issues, but packagers are permitted to block any provider of
virtual/libmysqlclient that does not work correctly. Enabling the
client-libs USE on a server package may be the necessary solution for
the rare case of portage reporting a block on an incompatible provider.
