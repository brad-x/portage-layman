  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

  06 Feb 2016; Aaron Bauman <bman@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  drop maintainer and reassign to proxy-maint

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26

  02 Apr 2016; Ian Delaney <idella4@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:

  remove proxy maintainer project, substitute with maintainer-needed

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

  02 Apr 2016; Sam Jorna <wraeth@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  set sci-geo maintainer

  12 Aug 2016; Marek Szuba <marecki@gentoo.org> osm-gps-map-0.7.3.ebuild:
  move version 0.7.3 to slot 2

  This is to make room for ebuilds of version 1.0.0 and newer, which among
  other
  changes are linked against gtk3 instead of gtk2 and have a different library
  name.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0

*osm-gps-map-1.1.0 (12 Aug 2016)

  12 Aug 2016; Marek Szuba <marecki@gentoo.org>
  +files/osm-gps-map-1.1.0-no-maintainer-mode.patch,
  +osm-gps-map-1.1.0.ebuild:
  add ebuild for version 1.1.0

  Among other changes the new version uses a different library name, links
  against gtk3 instead of gtk2, and provides Python bindings via PyGObject
  rather
  than directly.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0

  12 Aug 2016; Marek Szuba <marecki@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  add myself as primary maintainer.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0

  15 Aug 2016; Marek Szuba <marecki@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Revert "sci-geosciences/osm-gps-map: add myself as primary maintainer."

  Turns out the maintainership request made in bug 499592 was out of date,
  even though the assignee of the bug was still proxy-maint.

  This reverts commit ab80ad5b80b6e3e351714eb19a75fe0f6f4e0ed0.

  15 Aug 2016; Marek Szuba <marecki@gentoo.org>

  -osm-gps-map-1.1.0.ebuild:
  Revert "sci-geosciences/osm-gps-map: add ebuild for version 1.1.0"

  Unfortunately in spite of the upstream statement that 0.7.3 and 1.0.0+
  can be installed in parallel there are several file collisions between
  the two versions, some of which (notably introspection support) are not
  trivial to fix on our end. Filing an upstream bug report, hopefully the
  next release will not require jumping through so many hoops.

  This reverts commit f84d5f38689d291273eab2a3d735f07711eecde9.

  15 Aug 2016; Marek Szuba <marecki@gentoo.org> osm-gps-map-0.7.3.ebuild:
  Revert "sci-geosciences/osm-gps-map: move version 0.7.3 to slot 2"

  Return to original state until the new version can really be installed
  in parallel with this one.

  This reverts commit 7b88e7dd798f0a6e11e4f242c33f98543ec9a9c4.
