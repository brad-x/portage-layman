*ddctool-0.4.2 (04 Sep 2016)

  04 Sep 2016; David Seifert <soap@gentoo.org> +ddctool-0.4.2.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  New package

  ddctool primarily uses DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface)
  to communicate with monitors implementing MCCS (Monitor Control Command
  Set) over I2C. Normally, the video driver for the monitor exposes the
  I2C channel as devices named /dev/i2c-n. Alternatively, there is initial
  support for monitors (such as Apple displays) that implement MCCS using
  a USB connection.

*ddctool-0.5.0 (12 Sep 2016)

  12 Sep 2016; Patrice Clement <monsieurp@gentoo.org> -ddctool-0.4.2.ebuild,
  +ddctool-0.5.0.ebuild, metadata.xml:
  version bump to 0.5.0.

  - Updated dependencies based on new information from upstream.
  - Added new configure options added in this release
  - Renamed the use flags to better reflect what they do (in part
    due to the above mentioned config changes).
  - Remove old version as upstream doesn't want it used in a
    production environment.

  This is considered the first formal release by upstream. Previous
  versions were more like an alpha version.
