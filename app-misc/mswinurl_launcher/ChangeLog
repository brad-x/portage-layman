*mswinurl_launcher-1.0 (29 Oct 2016)

  29 Oct 2016; Ian Stakenvicius <axs@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +mswinurl_launcher-1.0.ebuild:
  rescue from sunrise

  This package has been a long time coming.  Introduced to the Sunrise overlay
  in 2008,
  it was kept out of the tree primarily due to a license issue (since the
  upstream script
  doesn't have one).  To be honest I'm not sure if *.url files are still
  created in
  recent versions of Windows anymore, but I personally still have filesystems
  with WindowsXP
  installed on them that I only access through linux, and having this file
  association open
  the url in my system's default browser is quite handy.

  The main difference between this package and that from Sunrise is that the
  .desktop file
  is created inline rather than being a separate file, and that there is an
  appropriate
  LICENSE and RESTRICT=mirror to allow the package to legally exist in the
  gentoo repo.  This
  ebuild has also been converted to EAPI6.

  The ChangeLog from sunrise is as follows:

    10 Sep 2009; Thomas Sachau (Tommy[D]) <tommy@gentoo.org>
    mswinurl_launcher-1.0.ebuild:
    Drop src_unpack and S assignment, use DISTDIR in src_install directly
