  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  31 Dec 2015; Brian Evans <grknight@gentoo.org> +mysql-5.6-r7.ebuild:
  Revbump to add PDEPEND wrt bug 556432

  Moved virtual/libmysqlclient to PDEPEND to fix new installs
  Portage sometimes would place the dependencies out of order
  and this is an attempt to fix it so both virtuals can be
  satisfied by the same package.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26
