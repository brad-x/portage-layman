  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  06 Feb 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +files/sqldeveloper-r1,
  +sqldeveloper-4.1.3.20.78-r1.ebuild:
  Use jtds:1.3, auto select 1.8 JVM, other fixes

  Java team needs to remove Java 6 ASAP and jtds:1.2 is holding this
  back. Upstream suggests 1.2 but 1.3 is reported to work. I wasn't able
  to test against a real database but it did at least try to connect.

  Asking users to manually switch their JVM before using this isn't very
  polite and not usually necessary thanks to Gentoo's launcher
  scripts. Those scripts cannot feasibly be used here but we can at
  least write package.env and use gjl to select the JVM intelligently.

  Other fixes:

   * Remove java-config from RDEPEND, it's implied by java-pkg-2 eclass.
   * Add some missing dies and remove some unnecessary dies.
   * Use newicon instead of mv + doicon.
   * Use exec in launcher to prevent lingering process.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.27
