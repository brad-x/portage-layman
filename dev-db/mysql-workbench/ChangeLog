  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  mysql-workbench-6.3.4-r2.ebuild:
  remove antlr dependency, bug 570600

  It turns out that this dependency is not actually needed and
  we also don't need to download the antlr files as we did in
  previous revisions. See bug 570600 for an analysis by Chewi.

  problem and providing a patch.
