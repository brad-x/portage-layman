  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*pypolicyd-spf-1.3.2-r1 (15 Sep 2015)

  15 Sep 2015; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> -pypolicyd-spf-1.3.2.ebuild,
  +pypolicyd-spf-1.3.2-r1.ebuild:
  remove python2 support to avoid ipaddress conflict.

  Current versions of pypolicyd-spf support both python2 and
  python3. With python2, the dev-python/ipaddr library provides support
  for IP address parsing. And with python3 (>= 3.3), the built-in
  ipaddress module is used. In fact, this determination is made based on
  the presence (or absence) of the ipaddress module.

  So far this has been fine. But recently, dev-python/ipaddress was
  introduced to backport the python3 ipaddress module to python2. Now,
  when dev-python/ipaddress is detected, pypolicyd-spf (incorrectly)
  assumes the python3 implementation. This is bug #559364 by Robert
  Trace.

  Upstream will be python3-only in the next release. They have suggested
  that we drop support for python2, and that's what this revision
  does. Since this can cause mail to be rejected or delayed, the new
  revision replaces the original.

  Bug: 559364
