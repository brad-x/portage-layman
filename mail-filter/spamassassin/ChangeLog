  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Remove explicit notion of maintainer-needed, for GLEP 67

  GLEP 67 removes the explicit notion of maintainer-needed@g.o being used
  for packages lacking maintainers, in favor of assuming maintainer-needed
  whenever the package has no maintainers.

  28 Feb 2016; Ulrich Müller <ulm@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  metadata.xml: Add maintainer-needed comment to packages without maintainer.

  new revision to fix Net-DNS compatibility issues.

  With the stabilization of =dev-perl/Net-DNS-1.40.0 (and the removal of
  the older stable version), a number of problems were introduced in
  SpamAssassin. There are three upstream bugs with patches against the
  latest release, v3.4.1, which fix all sorts of DNS errors in blacklist
  checks, DKIM, and SPF.

  The major contribution of this new revision is to apply patches from
  those upstream bugs fixing compatibility with =dev-perl/Net-DNS-1.40.0.

  At the same time, bug 396307 has been fixed by creating the
  sa-update-keys directory and assigning it the proper permissions.

  Thanks are due to Olliver Schinagl, Philippe Chaintreuil, Marcin
  Mirosław, and Atman Sense who reported and investigated these issues.

*spamassassin-3.4.1-r4 (03 Jun 2016)

  03 Jun 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  +spamassassin-3.4.1-r4.ebuild:
  new major revision to install module man pages.

  In bug 494260, it was reported that several man pages for
  SpamAssassin's perl modules are missing. This turns out to be the
  fault of the perl-module eclass, which deletes those man pages after
  they've been installed in src_install. To fix it, at the very least,
  would require avoiding perl-module_src_install().

  It appears that we're not using too much functionality of that eclass,
  especially once a workaround for src_install is in place. So in this
  commit, I have removed the dependency on perl-module.eclass entirely
  and configured/built/installed the package "manually." This fixes the
  documentation bug.

  Now with the eclass gone, it became possible to move to EAPI=6, and
  this allowed even more code cleanup, such as the removal of
  src_prepare() and the use of the default src_test(). The eutils eclass
  is then no longer needed, and einstalldocs() can be used. After adding
  "test" to IUSE, I noticed that the "doc" USE flag was redundant and
  removed it.

  Finally, the postinst message was updated to point to a new wiki page,
  https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SpamAssassin, which partially addresses
  bug 532094 and gets rid of some outdated information.

*spamassassin-3.4.1-r5 (04 Jun 2016)

  04 Jun 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> +files/3.4.1-spamd.conf,
  +files/3.4.1-spamd.init, +files/spamassassin-3.4.1-bug_7199.patch,
  +spamassassin-3.4.1-r5.ebuild:
  new revision with LibreSSL and spamd fixes.

  This new revision adds another patch for upstream bugs 7093/7199. The
  sslv3 option for spamd didn't do what it was supposed to do, and
  moreover, it broke LibreSSL which no longer supports SSLv3. The patch
  removes the option and makes it an error. There is a simple fix for
  users, to remove the --ssl-version option if they are using it. Thanks
  to Reuben Farrelly for reporting the issue.

  The second round of changes addresses a few old Gentoo bugs regarding
  the spamd init scripts and configuration. First, the init script was
  missing a call to "checkpath" to ensure that the PID file had some
  place to live. That's now fixed. Second, it used to be the case that
  some configuration was necessary if you opted to run spamd as a
  non-root user. That is no longer the case, so all of the documentation
  surrounding that issue has been removed, and the config/init scripts
  greatly simplified. Finally, a SPAMD_TIMEOUT option was added to allow
  spamd a little bit of time when restarting or shutting down.

  Peter Gantner, Juan David Ibáñez Palomar, Marcin Mirosław, Frieder
  Bürzele, and a few other people helped out on those bugs. Thanks!

  +files/update-spamassassin-rules.cron, metadata.xml,
  +spamassassin-3.4.1-r6.ebuild:
  new revision with an optional sa-update cron job.

  To make life easier for our users, a cron job that runs sa-update
  nightly has been provided. It is only installed with USE=cron, but an
  elog will mention its existence when that USE flag is disabled. The
  cron job will also attempt to restart or reload spamd/amavisd if the
  signatures have been updated.

  Alongside that new feature, some of the dependencies have been cleaned
  up. Pointless version bounds were removed, and an obsolete perl module
  or two was pruned. The libwww-perl dependency was replaced by
  wget/curl.

  update metadata.xml with new maintainers.

  We had a few users request to proxy-maintain this package. Now that
  its open bugs are fixed, this commit adds two of those users (Philippe
  Chaintreuil and Marcin Mirosław) to metadata.xml. The Proxy
  Maintainers project has been added to support them.

  I've added myself, too, for now, so that I will be CCed on bugs
  arising from my recent changes.

  new revision adding a Net-CIDR-Lite dependency.

  plugin, so it has been added to RDEPEND (dev-perl/Net-CIDR-Lite).

  05 Sep 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  -spamassassin-3.4.1-r7.ebuild, +spamassassin-3.4.1-r8.ebuild:
  new revision with correct build dependencies.

  The existing dependencies for spamassassin were all thrown into
  DEPEND and then propagated to RDEPEND -- even the ones that were
  obviously only needed at runtime. Marcin Mirosław helped track down
  the correct value of DEPEND, and the rest of the optional dependencies
  were moved to RDEPEND.

  The required and optional dependencies are now stored in
  REQDEPEND/OPTDEPEND variables to eliminate duplication. This is
  primarily useful with USE=test, which makes DEPEND a superset of
  RDEPEND, since the other inclusion alreads holds normally. Once the
  test suite had the correct dependencies, the RESTRICT=test was
  removed, and problematic spamc/spamd tests were disabled. The test
  suite should pass now.
