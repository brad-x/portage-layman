*libudev-compat-186 (28 Aug 2015)

  28 Aug 2015; Jonathan Callen <jcallen@gentoo.org> +files/udev_old.c,
  +libudev-compat-186.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  New package

  This installs a libudev.so.0 that wraps libudev.so.1 and provides the
  few functions that were removed with the SONAME bump.  This is only
  needed for some older binary-only software, including Steam.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1
