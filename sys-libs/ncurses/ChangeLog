  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-5.9-r3.ebuild,
  ncurses-5.9-r4.ebuild:
  use libgpm.so.1 all the time #544828

  Since the gpm code relies on running ldd on the linked file in order to
  calculate the SONAME, and we're passing this in as a configure flag some
  of the time, just change the code to always pass it in.  This stabilizes
  behavior across cross-compiling/multilib/ldd output/etc...  Relying on
  ldd output in general is bad juju.

*ncurses-6.0 (12 Aug 2015)

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>
  +files/ncurses-6.0-gfbsd.patch, +files/ncurses-6.0-pkg-config.patch,
  +files/ncurses-6.0-rxvt-unicode-9.15.patch, +ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  version bump to 6.0

  The bare min changes are here to get it working as more updates will
  follow.  Focus is on making the base ABI match upstream defaults for
  this release -- namely that we update to ABI 6 which includes colors
  and other new extended features. #373767

  Based on work by Lars Wendler.

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  simplify the multilib dep logic

  Block the emul package all the time now that it's no longer in the tree.

  Unify the gpm deps since there's already a circular dep here and the
  multilib code makes no real difference in that respect.

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  build the C++ libs as shared

  Since upstream has a configure flag for this now, we should be able to
  build+install the C++ layers as shared libs instead of only making the
  static libs available.

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  avoid building tests when unused

  If the user isn't going to run the testsuite, there's no point in building
  all the test binaries, so put that logic behind the standard USE=test.

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  rework disabling of progs

  Since the configure script has an option to disable progs, leverage that
  instead of whiting out a random make variable.  It's the same result, but
  feels cleaner and requires less code.

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  run configure steps in parallel

  This gives us a nice speed boost as the configure script is quite large.
  Follow up changes will make this more apparent (when we run configure up
  to 4 times instead of just 2).

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  rework use of BUILD_DIR

  Rather than maintain parallel dirs, create subdirs of the main BUILD_DIR.
  This makes the overall flow a bit simpler as we can also stick the cross
  logic in there too.

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  add USE=threads support #510440

  Now that we support the new ABI 6, we can support installing the threaded
  versions of ncurses alongside the non-threaded.

  12 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>
  +files/ncurses-6.0-ticlib.patch, ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  fix header mismatch with multilib installs #557360

  The progs change had a subtle effect that broke multilib builds.
  A few ticlib headers aren't installed when progs are disabled.
  Add a patch to always install them regardless of the progs state.

  17 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  block older x11-terms/st #557454

  17 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  rework handling of build-time tic #557834

  There are more cases where a version of tic is needed that matches the
  current version of source beyond cross-compiling.  New installs, multilib,
  and upgrades also run into this case.  Drop the cross-compile test and run
  the code whenever the host version isn't in sync.

  ncurses-5.9-r4.ebuild, ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  move to SLOT=0 #557472

  Use SLOT=0 for installing of main development files like other packages
  so we can use other SLOTs for installing SONAME libs for binary packages.

*ncurses-5.9-r100 (26 Aug 2015)

  26 Aug 2015; Justin Lecher <jlec@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,

  +ncurses-5.9-r101.ebuild:
  rewrite SLOT=5 ebuild #557472

  Delete code that doesn't make sense in an ABI-only ebuild,
  and backport changes from the ncurses-6 ebuild.

*ncurses-5.9-r99 (27 Aug 2015)
*ncurses-5.9-r5 (27 Aug 2015)

  27 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> +ncurses-5.9-r5.ebuild,
  +ncurses-5.9-r99.ebuild, ncurses-6.0.ebuild:
  add dummy package to bridge SLOT move #558856

  Since the slotmove operator does not properly update implicit subslots
  in generated dependencies in the vdb, add a dummy ebuild to bridge the
  old SLOT=5[/5] and the new SLOT=0/5.

  30 Aug 2015; Mike Gilbert <floppym@gentoo.org> ncurses-6.0-r1.ebuild:

  Otherwise, we match against sys-libs/ncurses-6.0:5/6, which does not
  include the tic command.
