  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  24 Aug 2015; Mike Gilbert <floppym@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Revert DOCTYPE SYSTEM https changes in metadata.xml

  repoman does not yet accept the https version.
  This partially reverts eaaface92ee81f30a6ac66fe7acbcc42c00dc450.

  Bug: https://bugs.gentoo.org/552720

  26 Aug 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> readline-7.0_alpha.ebuild:
  sys-libs/ncurses: move to SLOT=0 #557472

  Use SLOT=0 for installing of main development files like other packages
  so we can use other SLOTs for installing SONAME libs for binary packages.

*readline-7.0_beta (15 Oct 2015)

  15 Oct 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> -readline-7.0_alpha.ebuild,
  +readline-7.0_beta.ebuild:
  version bump to 7.0_beta

  24 Oct 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> readline-4.3_p5.ebuild,
  readline-5.2_p14.ebuild:
  add multilib support to older SLOTs #563884

  This makes the two old SLOTs look more like each other.  It drops the
  CONF_LIBDIR hack as this seems to date back to really old versions of
  portage.  There is no automatic logic in the configure scripts.

  24 Nov 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  standardize various metadata.xml style
