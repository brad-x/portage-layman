  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  Remove explicit notion of maintainer-needed, for GLEP 67

  GLEP 67 removes the explicit notion of maintainer-needed@g.o being used
  for packages lacking maintainers, in favor of assuming maintainer-needed
  whenever the package has no maintainers.

  28 Feb 2016; Ulrich Müller <ulm@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  metadata.xml: Add maintainer-needed comment to packages without maintainer.

*skyutils-2.8-r3 (26 Jun 2016)

  26 Jun 2016; Anthony G. Basile <blueness@gentoo.org>
  +skyutils-2.8-r3.ebuild:
  add libressl support

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

*skyutils-2.8-r4 (06 Aug 2016)

  06 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  +files/fix-Wformat-security-warnings.patch, metadata.xml,
  -skyutils-2.8-r3.ebuild, +skyutils-2.8-r4.ebuild:
  new revision to fix build bugs.

  This new revision updates to EAPI=6, and adds a patch that enables the
  build to complete with -Werror=format-security. It also adds an
  "sslv3" USE flag, because there is at least one package
  (app-mobilephone/smssend) which should require skyutils to be build
  against OpenSSL with sslv3 support.

*skyutils-2.8-r5 (07 Aug 2016)

  07 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  -skyutils-2.8-r4.ebuild, +skyutils-2.8-r5.ebuild:
  app-mobilephone/smssend, dev-libs/skyutils: fix SSLv3 support.

  In commits 790eacc and ac28332, I added an "sslv3" USE flag to
  dev-libs/skyutils and revisioned app-mobilephone/smssend to depend on
  it. This fix was insufficient; any other programs linking to
  libskyutils would suffer the same problem, as Michał Górny pointed
  out.

  Two new revisions of the affected packages remove the "sslv3" option
  for dev-libs/skyutils, and make it depend on openssl[sslv3] when the
  user asks for SSL support. Note: this required the removal of LibreSSL
  support on skyutils. The new revision of app-mobilephone/smssend now
  depends on the fixed revision of skyutils.

  An additional fix was made, and now smssend depends on
  skyutils[ssl]. Without SSL support in libskyutils, many SMS providers
  simply don't work.
