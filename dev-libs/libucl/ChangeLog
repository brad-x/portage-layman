*libucl-0.7.3 (04 Feb 2016)

  04 Feb 2016; Johan Bergström <bugs@bergstroem.nu> +libucl-0.7.3.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  New package

  Libucl is a configuration library parser
  and a set of optional utilities.

  08 Feb 2016; Johan Bergström <bugs@bergstroem.nu> libucl-0.7.3.ebuild:
  dev-libs/{lib,}ucl: Avoid simultaneous installation

  Both libraries opts to use /usr/{include,lib}/libucl* which
  leads to a conflict. There unfortunately doesn't seem to be
  a resolution upstream; dev-libs/ucl is 12 years old and
  dev-libs/libucl has stated that no changes related to this
  will occur.

  19 Jun 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Multiple metadata.xml: reorder to make sure assignee goes first

  Reorder all metadata.xml files with explicit descriptions requesting
  particular bug assignment/CC to ensure that the requested assignee
  always goes first, in order to match the bug wrangling policies.

  03 Nov 2016; Göktürk Yüksek <gokturk@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  remove proxied maintainer per his request

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28
