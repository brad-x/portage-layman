  dev-libs/libiconv: split out from gettext

  The gettext ebuild is big and fat and full of tools/deps that are
  independent of libintl.  Since slimming that down with USE flags
  gets ugly fast (it provides multiple libs in addition to tools),
  just create a dedicated libintl package.

  13 Oct 2015; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> libintl-0.19.6.ebuild:
  drop USE=nls flag

  The related commit in gettext (030b323567f9546c35d9cf1182f36b2b54e08)
  was wrong -- the internal configure logic skips the libintl flag when
  nls support is disabled.  It doesn't matter there now as libintl has
  been dropped, but it still matters here as w/out the flag, no library
  is built.  So drop the flag, hardcode the option, and add a comment
  to keep from screwing it up in the future.
