  +metadata.xml:
  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  Revert DOCTYPE SYSTEM https changes in metadata.xml

  repoman does not yet accept the https version.
  This partially reverts eaaface92ee81f30a6ac66fe7acbcc42c00dc450.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Remove explicit notion of maintainer-needed, for GLEP 67

  GLEP 67 removes the explicit notion of maintainer-needed@g.o being used
  for packages lacking maintainers, in favor of assuming maintainer-needed
  whenever the package has no maintainers.

  28 Feb 2016; Ulrich Müller <ulm@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  metadata.xml: Add maintainer-needed comment to packages without maintainer.

*gecode-4.4.0 (01 Aug 2016)

  01 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> +gecode-4.4.0.ebuild,
  metadata.xml:
  new version 4.4.0.

  This version bump fixes at least two open bugs. The first simply asked
  for a version bump, and the second reported a failure when /bin/sh is
  dash (now fixed).

  Along with the new version, some ebuild cleanup was done. The ebuild
  is now EAPI=6, and the "gmp" USE flag was added to control building
  with float constraints. Three superfluous runtime dependencies
  (transitive through Qt) were removed, and two new build dependencies
  needed to generate the documentation were added.

  The src_test() phase has been re-enabled with an LD_LIBRARY hack to
  make sure that the test suite is run against the just-build libraries.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

  01 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> -gecode-3.7.3.ebuild:
  remove old version 3.7.3 to fix QA warnings.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28

*gecode-3.7.3 (01 Aug 2016)

  01 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> +gecode-3.7.3.ebuild:
  Revert "dev-libs/gecode: remove old version 3.7.3 to fix QA warnings."

  This reverts commit 395d5ea72bceca3087e602683b43e279f5ca0b71. The
  dev-ruby/dep_selector package has a dependency on >=gecode3.5.0, but
  at the moment it can only be satisfied by gecode-3.x, so we need to
  leave v3.7.3 in the tree. There is an upstream pull request (#44) to
  support gecode 4.x.

  01 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  fix metadata.xml schema.

  In my recent addition of gecode-4.4.0, I made a copy/paste error and
  duplicated the <use> element in metadata.xml. Michał's Travis CI
  instance caught the error (thanks).

*gecode-4.4.0-r1 (29 Sep 2016)

  29 Sep 2016; Michael Palimaka <kensington@gentoo.org>
  +files/gecode-4.4.0-no-examples.patch, +gecode-4.4.0-r1.ebuild:
  revision bump fixing numerous QA violations

  * Add missing dependencies

  * Avoid hard-coded CFLAGS

  * Do not install examples to system root

  * Install HTML documentation to the correct directory

  * Remove unused test USE flag

  * Do not allow sci-libs/mpir as a runtime alternative to sci-libs/mpir. This
  can only be selected at build time.

  * Force building libgecodegist.so against Qt 4 again. Careful consideration
  must
  be given to reverse dependencies before switching to Qt 5 due to the
  potential
  for symbol collisions and ABI breakage. Additionally, the existing approach
  is not valid because Qt versions are not interchangeable at runtime.
