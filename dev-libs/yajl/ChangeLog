  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  21 Mar 2016; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> +yajl-1.0.12.ebuild:
  bump latest legacy yajl

  The 1.x series is considered legacy but we should at least have it since
  some utilities still use/need the 1.x series. Set the sub-SLOT to 1 to
  help with package dependency rebuilds.

  what upstream has used since 2.0.0.
