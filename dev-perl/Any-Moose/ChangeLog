  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*Any-Moose-0.260.0-r1 (29 Feb 2016)

  29 Feb 2016; Kent Fredric <kentfredric@gmail.com>
  +Any-Moose-0.260.0-r1.ebuild, +files/nomouse.patch:
  Eliminate dependencies on Mouse

  This is preparation work for eventual removal of Any-Moose from tree,
  as it is declared "Deprecated" by upstream, and people who want a
  "Be fast by default but still work with Moose" solution are being encouraged
  to use Moo instead.

  Any-Moose will continue to auto-switch between Moose and Mouse
  if Mouse is installed, but will not add any dependencies on Mouse
  and will no longer test Mouse based tests, with the idea being to
  just force the Moose path by default.

  This is effectively what already happened for anyone who installed Moose
  first,
  which is highly likely, because *nothing* in tree other than Any-Moose and
  its children presently depend on Mouse.

  However, we can't remove Any-Moose yet, because some packages still depend
  on it,
  so this patch is intended to mitigate the damage of still pulling Mouse and
  MouseX::Types
  into tree.

  This also avoids a circular dependency mess under FEATURES="test"

  But anyone who wants the runtime benefits of Any-Moose that *may* appear
  if they're not using any Moose code, they can still get that benefit by
  installing
  Mouse manually.

  But otherwise, depending on Any-Moose should imply a dependecy on Moose
