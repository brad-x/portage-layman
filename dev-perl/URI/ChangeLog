  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  Bump to version 1.710.0

  - EAPI6
  - Re-enable tests because there is no evidence that network IO is being done
    anymore. Please file bugs with specific details of which tests fail and
  how
    if there are any bugs on this, so we can mask out *only* failing tests.

  Upstream:
  - Better error handling when loading URI subclasses
  - Construction time made faster w/ no redundant loading of known missing
  plugins.
