  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  02 Aug 2016; Kent Fredric <kentnl@gentoo.org> Test-Deep-1.120.0.ebuild:
  Weaken dependency on dev-perl/Test-Tester

  Without this fix, Test-Deep effectively needs perl-5.22
  stabilized in order to satisfy Test-Tester from Perl-5.22

  However, satisfying Test-Tester from a mechanism other than Perl-5.22
  confuses portages dependency resolver, and confuses portage to not be able
  to upgrade perl, and not being able to upgrade perl means perl can't be
  stabilized, invoking a stabilization-needs-stabilization bug.

  Hence, the choice here optimises for assuming stabilization will
  happen/has happened, and removes any dependency on Test::Tester, assuming
  portage will eventually provide it for you.

  And just to be sure, we use perl before the test phase executes
  to determine if Test::Tester was /actually/ installed and then only run
  tests
  if it was.

  This means before stabilization, some people *might* install this and not
  have
  tests run, but everyone *will* get tests working after stabilization, as
  opposed to the opposite occurring and stabilization being blocked.
