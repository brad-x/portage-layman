  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*XML-Parser-Lite-0.721.0 (29 Apr 2016)

  29 Apr 2016; Andreas K. Hüttel <dilfridge@gentoo.org>
  +XML-Parser-Lite-0.721.0.ebuild, metadata.xml:
  Bump to version 0.721.0

  - EAPI6
  - Exclude possible network test unless DIST_TEST_OVERRIDE inlcudes
  "network".
    (Note: this test could have pulled in other dependencies to test it under
  a useflag, but doing
     so introduces a dependency cycle, because the test in question is to test
  for regressions in those
     things. Instead, this test will still be present if network testing is
  enabled, and will auto-activate
     if somebody happens to satisfy the dependencies)

  Upstream:
  - Packaging changes ( esp in regards to circular dependency tests )
