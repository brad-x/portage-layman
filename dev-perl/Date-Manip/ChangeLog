  +Date-Manip-6.510.0.ebuild, +Date-Manip-6.520.0.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  Copy from dev-perl/DateManip

  This is to remove the weird SRC_URI !~ PN difference,
  that is causing bugs like bug:
  https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=436986

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.27

  04 Aug 2016; Kent Fredric <kentnl@gentoo.org> Date-Manip-6.510.0.ebuild,
  Date-Manip-6.520.0.ebuild:
  Remove POD Authortests

  This removes the various (optional) POD tests and the related
  dependencies as they can never serve an end user any benefit about
  reporting their dist broken.

  All it can do is introduce more things that break, and more dependencies
  for stabilization.

  Keywords:
  - This fix removes one broken keyword dependency issue,
    ~m68k -> Test-Pod-Coverage
  - dev-perl/Test-Inter is still unsatisfied on ~arm64 and ~m68k
  - virtual/perl-Storable is still unsatisfied on ~m68k

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0
  RepoMan-Options: --include-arches="alpha amd64 amd64-fbsd arm hppa ia64 mips
  nios2 ppc ppc64 riscv s390 sh sparc sparc-fbsd x86 x86-fbsd"
