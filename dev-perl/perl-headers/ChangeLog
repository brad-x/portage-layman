*perl-headers-0.0.1 (11 Sep 2016)

  11 Sep 2016; Kent Fredric <kentnl@gentoo.org> +files/README.gentoo,
  +metadata.xml, +perl-headers-0.0.1.ebuild:
  Added at 0.0.1

  This is some work to restore the logic that was previously
  shipped with dev-lang/perl before 5.24 and was trimmed
  for lack of evidence of use, and the conflating design issues
  that manifested from being installed during pkg_postinst

  This should be at least as good as that, if not better.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0
