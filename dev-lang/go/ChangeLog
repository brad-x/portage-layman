  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  21 Aug 2015; William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org> go-9999.ebuild:
  add support for cross-compiling

  There are a few quirks with Go to deal with when cross-compiling:

   - Since DEPEND cannot distinguish cross-architecture dependencies the
     current ebuild cannot keyword all architectures it supports. This
     could be resolved in the future with a special use flag or other
     clever trick to drop go-bootstrap from DEPEND for cross builds.

   - GOHOST* and CC variables are CBUILD values.

   - GO* and *_FOR_TARGET variables are CHOST values.

   - Go can always be used as a cross-compiler so handling the
     CHOST!=CTARGET case isn't strictly required. We could provide a
     pre-built copy of the std library for CTARGET's architecture but I'm
     not sure if that would be useful or not. For now the ebuild just
     doesn't allow that case.

   - Note from WilliamH: I made some small style changes to this commit.

  This is for bug #558216.

  21 Aug 2015; William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org> go-9999.ebuild:

  version of go-tools installed when upgrading.

  This is for bug #560054.
