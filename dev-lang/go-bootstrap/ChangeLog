  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  23 Aug 2015; William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org> go-bootstrap-1.4.2.ebuild:
  avoid stripping test data files

  Go includes a number of pre-built object files for testing. Since they
  are not actually executed and may not even be native to the local system
  stripping them is meaningless. This syncs up STRIP_MASK with the same
  list used by the latest go ebuilds.

  One file, src/debug/dwarf/testdata/typedef.elf, includes a build-id
  which causes a conflict with the go-1.4 when FEATURES=splitdebug is
  enabled.

  Fixes bug #549598

  Revert DOCTYPE SYSTEM https changes in metadata.xml

  repoman does not yet accept the https version.
  This partially reverts eaaface92ee81f30a6ac66fe7acbcc42c00dc450.
