  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*ucblogo-6.0-r2 (14 Aug 2016)

  14 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  +files/ucblogo-6.0-optimization-flags.patch, +ucblogo-6.0-r2.ebuild:
  new revision to fix a few open bugs.

  The build system for this package forces -O0, and we have an ancient
  bug for that. The only way to fix it is with a patch, and this new
  revision adds a patch stripping the -O0.

  There is also a build failure in the existing 6.x series
  ebuilds. There is wxWidgets support hidden behind USE=X, but we make a
  call to some wxWidgets stuff unconditionally and it crashes when
  wxWidgets is not present (i.e. with USE="-X").

  The elisp-common eclass is no longer used and has been dropped. A call
  to strip-flags has been removed, and flag-o-matic "downgraded" to
  toolchain-funcs.
