  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*pecl-yaml-1.2.0 (25 Sep 2015)

  25 Sep 2015; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> -pecl-yaml-1.1.1.ebuild,
  -pecl-yaml-1.1.1-r1.ebuild, +pecl-yaml-1.2.0.ebuild:
  version bump to v1.2.0.

  The two ebuilds for version 1.1.1 had an erroneous "EXPERIMENTAL"
  listed in DOCS. As a result, they were removed as part of the version
  bump.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1

*pecl-yaml-2.0.0_rc5 (06 Nov 2015)

  06 Nov 2015; Brian Evans <grknight@gentoo.org> +pecl-yaml-2.0.0_rc5.ebuild:
  Version bump to 2.0.0_rc5

  This version only works with >=dev-lang/php-7.0

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.23

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Set appropriate maintainer types in metadata.xml (GLEP 67)

  21 May 2016; Pacho Ramos <pacho@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Cleanup due to #321263
