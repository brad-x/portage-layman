  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*pear-1.10.0_alpha2 (16 Aug 2015)

  16 Aug 2015; Brian Evans <grknight@gentoo.org> +pear-1.10.0_alpha2.ebuild:
  dev-php/{pear,PEAR-PEAR}: Version bump for PHP7 compatible version

  This is being committed as masked because I expect many older PEAR
  packages to break with the new format.

  Further testing is required on all PEAR packages before unmasking.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1
