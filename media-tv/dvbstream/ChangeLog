  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Unify quoting in metadata.xml files for machine processing

  Force unified quoting in all metadata.xml files since lxml does not
  preserve original use of single and double quotes. Ensuring unified
  quoting before the process allows distinguishing the GLEP 67-related
  metadata.xml changes from unrelated quoting changes.

  24 Jan 2016; Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  Replace all herds with appropriate projects (GLEP 67)

  Replace all uses of herd with appropriate project maintainers, or no
  maintainers in case of herds requested to be disbanded.

  28 Feb 2016; Ulrich Müller <ulm@gentoo.org> metadata.xml:
  metadata.xml: Add maintainer-needed comment to packages without maintainer.

*dvbstream-0.7_pre20080516-r1 (12 Aug 2016)

  12 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org>
  +dvbstream-0.7_pre20080516-r1.ebuild:
  new revision respecting LDFLAGS.

  This is a new revision with an update to EAPI=6 and a little ebuild
  cleanup. Some missing die() statements were added, and some file
  copying was avoided by using the newbin/newdoc helpers. Most
  importantly, Michael Mair-Keimberger's fix to support LDFLAGS was
  incorporated.

  I built the package on amd64, so I've keyworded it ~amd64 as well.

  Gentoo-Bug: 337327
