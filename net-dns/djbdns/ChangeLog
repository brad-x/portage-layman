  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*djbdns-1.05-r31 (05 Aug 2016)

  05 Aug 2016; Michael Orlitzky <mjo@gentoo.org> +djbdns-1.05-r31.ebuild,
  +files/1.05-errno-r1.patch, +files/CVE2008-4392_0001-dnscache-merge-similar-
  outgoing-queries-ipv6-test25-r1.patch,
  +files/CVE2008-4392_0001-dnscache-merge-similar-outgoing-queries-r1.patch,
  +files/headtail-r1.patch, +files/increase-cname-recustion-depth.patch:
  new revision with increased dnscache recursion depth.

  There is a hard limit on the number of recursive queries that dnscache
  will perform. This new revision adds a patch, increasing a loop
  iteration limit from 100 to 200, and thus increasing the recursion
  depth. The patch was based on a similar fix for OpenWrt, suggested by
  John Stile.

  With the new revision, the ebuild was updated to EAPI=6. The eutils
  eclass was dropped as "epatch" was replaced with "eapply"; some
  patches needed new revisions to work with -p1, as eapply does. Two
  other patches needed revisions to avoid fuzz from the new fix.
