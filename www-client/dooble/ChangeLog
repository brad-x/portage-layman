*dooble-1.55 (15 Nov 2015)

  15 Nov 2015; Richard Yao <ryao@gentoo.org> +dooble-1.55.ebuild,
  +files/00-dooble-1.55-path-fix.patch, +metadata.xml:
  new package, "a secure web browser"

  This is a rewrite of the www-client/dooble package from Sabayon's
  for-gentoo repository:

  https://github.com/Sabayon/for-gentoo/tree/master/www-client/dooble

  I have not audited the package to verify the security claims, but a
  cursory peek at how it restricts possible exploit vectors has been
  promising. I would like this to be scrutinized by others, but I feel
  good enough about this that I am committing it to ~amd64 for our users
  to evaluate.

  At the moment, I am only committing the Qt4 version, which is the 1.x
  series. The 2.x series is the Qt5 version. This probably should be
  changed to be slotted when that is committed.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.20.1
