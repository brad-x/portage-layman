  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*audacity-2.0.5-r1 (30 Oct 2015)

  30 Oct 2015; Marc Joliet <marcec@gmx.de> +audacity-2.0.5-r1.ebuild:
  fix libsamplerate/libsox dep

  Starting with audacity 2.0.3, only *one* resampling library can be enabled
  at a
  time.  Due to this, the way the USE flags are currently handled make it
  impossible to use the libsoxr library.  This commit does two things to
  remedy
  this:

  - never enable libresample (which isn't recommended anymore), and
  - drop the libsoxr USE flag so that the libsamplerate/libsoxr choice is
    controlled only through the libsamplerate USE flag, thus allowing only one
    choice, which reflects the way the build system works.

  These two minimal changes make it possible to properly select between the
  two
  recommended resampling libraries.

  06 Nov 2015; Marc Joliet <marcec@gmx.de> metadata.xml:
  fix libsoxr USE flag desc

  The description of the libsoxr USE flag is inaccurate: libsoxr is both
  faster
  *and* yields higher quality results than libsamplerate.  This matches the
  way
  the Audacity project described libsoxr in the 2.0.3 release notes at
  http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Release_Notes_2.0.3#Resampling, but can
  also
  be verified by comparing the two, e.g., at http://src.infinitewave.ca/.

  with regards to its impact on Audacity.
