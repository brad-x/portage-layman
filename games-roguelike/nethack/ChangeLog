  proj/gentoo: Initial commit

  This commit represents a new era for Gentoo:
  Storing the gentoo-x86 tree in Git, as converted from CVS.

  This commit is the start of the NEW history.
  Any historical data is intended to be grafted onto this point.

  Creation process:
  1. Take final CVS checkout snapshot
  2. Remove ALL ChangeLog* files
  3. Transform all Manifests to thin
  4. Remove empty Manifests
  5. Convert all stale $Header$/$Id$ CVS keywords to non-expanded Git $Id$
  5.1. Do not touch files with -kb/-ko keyword flags.

*nethack-3.4.3-r5 (19 Oct 2015)

  19 Oct 2015; Luis Ressel <aranea@aixah.de> +nethack-3.4.3-r5.ebuild:
  Move HACKDIR to /usr/lib

  Move nethack's HACKDIR (containing its static data) from /usr/share to
  /usr/lib because its contents are architecture-dependent. /usr/lib is
  the location recommended by upstream and also used by other distros.

  X-Gentoo-Bug: 97557

  19 Oct 2015; Luis Ressel <aranea@aixah.de> nethack-3.4.3-r5.ebuild:
  Install nethack menu icon

  X-Gentoo-Bug: 132754

  19 Oct 2015; Luis Ressel <aranea@aixah.de> nethack-3.4.3-r5.ebuild:
  Don't install dot.nethackrc to HACKDIR

  It's only a default config file to be used by users, there's another
  copy in /etc/skel, and there's an elog message to point users to the
  version in /etc/skel, so we really don't need this in $HACKDIR.

  19 Oct 2015; Luis Ressel <aranea@aixah.de> nethack-3.4.3-r5.ebuild:
  Add subslot operator to ncurses dep

  -nethack-3.4.3-r4.ebuild:
  Remove old revisions

  19 Oct 2015; Luis Ressel <aranea@aixah.de> nethack-3.4.3-r5.ebuild:
  Minor cleanup

  * Drop \ after && and ||
  * Drop reference to old X11 libdir
